            <h3 class="c_low_ttl01">Systematization of operations with CATI</h3>
            <p class="c_space">We have utilized Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), which is a computer system designed exclusively for telephone research, from an early stage. All of our telephone booths are now CATI ready.</p>
            <p>-Questionnaires are programmed in advance so that interviewers can conduct a survey smoothly even if the structure of a questionnaire is complicated.
                <br>-Logical checks are also carried out while the survey is conducted. The interviewer can ask a respondent about any consistencies found in the survey straight away, which leads to improvement in data accuracy.
                <br>-The sequence of questions and response alternatives can be rotated or randomized on the screen easily, and it helps eliminate bias that may arise by the flow of questions.
                <br>-Interviewers directly input answers to computers so that data can be submitted soon after the survey.
                <br>-We use Web Survey Creator (WSC), globally renowned software.</p>

            <h3 class="c_low_ttl01">RDD method for accuracy improvement</h3>
            <p>Random Digit Dialing (RDD) is a method to randomly dial phone numbers consisting of random digits generated on computers. This method allows us to make calls even to phone numbers not listed in the telephone directory, contributing to more accurate survey results. The RDD method can be used for mobile phones for which the telephone directory is usually not available.</p>

            <h3 class="c_low_ttl01">Mixed-frame surveys―Landlines and mobile phones</h3>
            <p>We made the RDD for mobile phones fit for practical use in addition to the existing one for landlines through many years of experimentation and trials in order to extend coverage to young people and people who do not use landlines. We are further working on the development of a system using mobile applications in research, balanced sampling, mixed-mode surveys among several methods, including telephone, internet, and mail.</p>
